monarp
======

I use this script on a couple of machines when testing out ARP poisoners and needed a central repository for the various flavors I have.

This will monitor for changes in the ARP cache and connection drops.

python monarp.py [SLEEP], where sleep is an optional timer for ARP updates.  Default is 5s.
